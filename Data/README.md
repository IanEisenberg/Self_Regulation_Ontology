This folder contains all of the data releases and derived data. 
Each folder is named with the sample name and the release date. The samples are:
* Discovery: 200 subjects assigned to discovery set
* Validation: 300 validation subjects
* Full: Full sample of all complete subjects
* Failed: non-completed subjects

These data should not be changed once being committed.  Any additional derived data should be placed in the appropriate
directory underneath the Derived_data folder.
